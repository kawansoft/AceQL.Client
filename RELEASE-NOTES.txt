                 AceQL C# Client SDK
                    Version 5.3.1
                    Release Notes


Introduction
------------

The SDK allows to wrap the AceQL HTTP APIs and 
eliminate the tedious works of handling communications errors and parsing 
JSON results.

C# application developers can access remote SQL databases and/or SQL databases 
in the cloud by simply including standard C# SQL calls in their code, just like 
they would do for an SQL Server database.

AceQL C# Client SDK - Version 5.3.1 - 11-Aug-2020
-------------------------------------------------

What's New:
- Internal: Use the Default/System Web Proxy Credentials if they are set 
  when creating the HttpClientHandler instance. 
  This should allow using successfully CredentialCache on some configurations.


AceQL C# Client SDK - Version 5.3 - 05-Aug-2020
-----------------------------------------------

Bugs fixed:
- A 407 HTTP status code could be returned when using a proxy along with 
  CredentialCache. This has been fixed.


AceQL C# Client SDK - Version 5.2 - 01-Aug-2020
-----------------------------------------------

What's New:
- The proxy detection layer has been rewritten.
- Experimental: The AceQLConnection.setDefaultProxy() method allows 
  to force the usage of System.Net.WebRequest.GetSystemWebProxy() instead of 
  System.Net.WebRequest.DefaultWebProxy value for default/global proxy.
   
Bugs fixed:
- The proxy configuration would not be applied if the URL http://www.google.com was 
  defined as an URL to bypass when using default or system proxy.
  This has been fixed.


AceQL C# Client SDK - Version 5.1 - 17-Jul-2020
-----------------------------------------------

What's New:
- New "UseCredentialCache=True" parameter setting in connection string allows
  AceQL to use automatically the CredentialCache authentications values 
  for the proxy to use.


AceQL C# Client SDK - Version 5.0.2 - 17-Jul-2020
-------------------------------------------------

What's New:
- Clean code using Codacy.com and SonarCSharp coding 
  conventions.


AceQL C# Client SDK - Version 5.0.1 - 15-Jul-2020
-------------------------------------------------

Bugs fixed:
- When using a WebProxy with authentication, a session could be interrupted 
  by 407 errors.
  This is due to a C# bug or feature of the HttClient implementation.
  A turnaround has been added by allowing to retry each AceQL HTTP call 
  that returns a 407 HTTP status code.

What's New:
- For better for stability and perfomances, All HTTP calls during an AceQL session 
  use the same C# native HttpClient instance.
- The AceQLConnection trace activation/deactivation methods have suppressed.
  Tracing is now activated by putting EnableTrace=true in the connection string.
- The mandatory presence of "Server" and "Database" properties in the connection 
  string are now checked.
- AceQLConnection.GetVersion() is now static. 
- All code follow now Codacy.com and SonarCSharp coding convention.



AceQL C# Client SDK - Version 5.0 - 14-Jul-2020
------------------------------------------------

Bugs fixed:
- On some Locales, setting a parameter with a DateTime value could fail.
  This has been fixed. 
- On some Locales, setting a parameter with a double or float value could fail.
  This has been fixed.


AceQL C# Client SDK - Version 4.2.1 - 06-Jun-2020
-------------------------------------------------
 
What's New:
- Parameter names checking has been enhanced.
- Missing parameter values are now more cleanly detected.
- Parameter errors have now cleaner messages.
- Most parameter checks are done locally, without submitting the requests 
  to the remote server.

Bugs fixed:
- Using a parameter whose name was a substring of the name of another parameter
  would raise an Exception. 
  Example: insert into my_table values (@NAME, @NAMESPACE)
  This has been fixed. 


AceQL C# Client SDK - Version 4.2 - 03-Jun-2020
-----------------------------------------------
 
What's New:
- Enable default system authentication. This is useful for configurations where a 
  third party system (for instance IIS) is placed between the client and the AceQL 
  Server and checks natively the authentication (for instance with Active Directory).


AceQL C# Client SDK - Version 4.1 - 01-Jun-2020
-----------------------------------------------
 
What's New:
- AceQL allows now client supplementary authentication without a password using 
  directly an existing AceQL Session ID.
  This has been asked by our users, because some working environments
  (Intranet, etc.) require that the client user authenticates himself without 
  a password. 


AceQL C# Client SDK - Version 4.0.3 - 07-Apr-2020
-------------------------------------------------

What's New:
- The AceQLConnection.PrettyPrinting property
  method has been removed, as the server requires JSON 
  pretty-printing to always be on in order to avoid hazardous 
  line splitting. 


AceQL C# Client SDK - Version 4.0.2 - 20-Jan-2020
-------------------------------------------------

What's New:
- RemoteDatabaseMetaData instance creation is now done using
  AceQLConnection.GetRemoteDatabaseMetaData().
- Overload RemoteDatabaseMetaData.DbSchemaDownloadAsync() method.
- Update and clean XML Documentation.


AceQL C# Client SDK - Version 4.0 - 15-Jan-2020
-----------------------------------------------

What's New:
- The new metadata API allows downloading the remote database schema
  in HTML or text format, to get the remote database main properties, 
  to get the list of tables, and to get the details of each table.
  It also allows wrapping remote tables, columns, indexes, etc into
  easy to use C# classes: Table, Index, Column, etc.


AceQL C# Client SDK - Version 3.0 - 24-dec-2018
-----------------------------------------------

What's New:
 - Trace default was on. This would slow down execution.
   This has been fixed: trace default status is off.
 - Trace management was static: there was only one trace file for all threads. 
   This has been fixed: there is now one trace file per thread.
 - This version allows to call remote stored procedures.
 - Syntax for setting NULL values has  been changed. See 
   User Guide.
 - This version requires AceQL Pro HTTP v2.1 server for 
   stored procedures calls.

   
AceQL C# Client SDK - Version 2.0 - 07-mar-2018
-----------------------------------------------

What's New:
 - This version is designed to operate with AceQL HTTP v2.0 
   on server  side.

   because done without server authentication.
 - This version is not compatible with AceQL HTTP v1.0 server
   side.


AceQL C# Client SDK - Version 1.1.2 - 29-dec-2017
-------------------------------------------------
